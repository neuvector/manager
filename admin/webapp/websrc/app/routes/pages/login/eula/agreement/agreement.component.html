      PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR
      OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ITS COMPONENTS), YOU AGREE TO THE
      TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT

      ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO
      ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY.
    </h4>
    <p>
      This End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between
      You (an entity or a person) and NeuVector, Inc. (“Licensor”). NeuVector
      software products for which You have acquired licenses, any media or
      reproductions (physical or virtual) and accompanying documentation
      (collectively the “Software”) are protected by the copyright laws and
      treaties of the United States (“U.S.”) and other countries and is subject
      to the terms of this Agreement. If the laws of Your principal place of
      business require contracts to be in the local language to be enforceable,
      such local language version may be obtained from Licensor upon written
      request and shall be deemed to govern Your purchase of licenses to the
      Software. Any add-on, extension, update, mobile application, module,
      adapter or support release to the Software that You may download or
      receive that is not accompanied by a license agreement is Software and is
      governed by this Agreement. If the Software is an update or support
      release, then You must have validly licensed the version and quantity of
      the Software being updated or supported in order to install or use the
      update or support release.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: #5eb77f">Licensed Use</h2>
    <h4>Open Source</h4>
    <p>
      Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit or otherwise affect any
      rights or obligations You may have, or conditions to which You may be
      subject, under any applicable open source licenses to any open source code
      contained in the Software. The Software may include or be bundled with
      other software programs licensed under different terms and/or licensed by
      a third party other than Licensor. Use of any software programs
      accompanied by a separate license agreement is governed by that separate
      license agreement.
    </p>
    <h4>Subscription Services and Support</h4>
    <p>
      Licensor has no obligation to provide maintenance or support unless You
      purchase a subscription offering that expressly includes such services.
      Licensor sells subscription offerings for the Software that entitles You
      to fee based technical support and/or internal use of Software updates
      provided on a specified annual period (“Subscription Offering”).
    </p>

      with respect to any trademark, trade name or service mark of Licensor or
      its Affiliates or licensors (“Mark”). This Agreement does not permit you
      to distribute the Software or its components using Licensor's trademarks,
      regardless of whether the copy has been modified. You may make a
      commercial redistribution of the Programs only if (a) permitted under a
      separate written agreement with Licensor authorizing such commercial
      redistribution, or (b) you remove and replace all occurrences of any Mark.
    </p>
    <h4>Ownership</h4>
    <p>

      and/or its third party licensors retain all right, title and interest in
      and to all intellectual property rights in the Software and Services,
      including any adaptations or copies thereof. The Software is not sold to
      You, You acquire only a conditional license to use the Software. Title,
      ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the content

      owner and may be protected by applicable copyright or other law. This
      Agreement gives You no rights to such content.

      licensors, subject to the applicable license. Licensor reserves all rights
      not expressly granted to You. The Software is licensed for Your internal
      use only. Except as this Agreement expressly allows and without limiting

      adherence to the following: (1) You remain responsible for all of Your
      obligations under this Agreement and enter into an enforceable agreement
      with the third party that contains terms and conditions to protect

      contained in this Agreement, including without limitation the Audits
      section below; (2) You prohibit use of the Software by the third party for
      any purpose other than Your sole benefit; (3) You are solely responsible
      to Licensor for any and all breaches of this Agreement by the third party;
      and (4) You are and will remain current on subscription purchases that
      cover all installations and deployments of the Software by the third party
      on Your behalf.
    </p>
    <h4>Appliance License</h4>
    <p>
      If, either directly from Licensor or from a third party, you have received
      a hardware, software or other appliance that uses the Software, You
      acknowledge and agree to use the Software solely for the purpose of
      running the appliance and not as a general purpose operating system.
    </p>

    <h4>Limited Warranty</h4>
    <p>
      Licensor warrants that the media that the Software is delivered on will be
      free from defects in materials and manufacture under normal use for a
      period of sixty (60) days from the date of delivery to you. THE FOREGOING
      WARRANTY IS YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER
      WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SAVE FOR THE FOREGOING WARRANTY, THE
      SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE OR
      DISTRIBUTION WITH ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS
      REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR
      FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION, COMMUNICATION, OR CONTROL SYSTEMS, DIRECT
      LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, WEAPONS SYSTEMS, OR OTHER USES IN WHICH FAILURE OF
      THE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE
      PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.
    </p>
    <h4>Non-Licensor Products</h4>
    <p>
      The Software may include or be bundled with hardware or other software
      programs or services licensed or sold by an entity other than Licensor.
      LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT NON-LICENSOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. ANY SUCH
      PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS. WARRANTY SERVICE IF

      AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT NOR ARE THERE
      ANY WARRANTIES CREATED BY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR
      TRADE USAGE. LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE NOT
      EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT
      THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL SATISFY YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE

      other rights which vary by state or jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <h4>Consequential Losses</h4>
